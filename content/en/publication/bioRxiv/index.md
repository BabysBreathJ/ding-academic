abstract: 'At present, drug toxicity has become a critical problem with heavy medical and 
economic burdens. acLQTS (acquired Long QT Syndrome) is acquired cardiac ion 
channel disease caused by drugs blocking the hERG channel. Therefore, it is 
necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity in the drug design and computer models have been 
widely used to fix this plight. In this study, we present a molecular fingerprint based 
on the molecular dynamic simulation and uses it combined with other molecular 
fingerprints (multi-dimensional molecular fingerprints) to predict hERG 
cardiotoxicity of compounds. 203 compounds with hERG inhibitory activity (pIC50) 
were retrieved from a previous study and predicting models were established using 
four machine learning algorithms based on the single and multi-dimensional 
molecular fingerprints. Results showed that MDFP has the potential to be an 
alternative to traditional molecular fingerprints and the combination of MDFP and 
traditional molecular fingerprints can achieve higher prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, 
the accuracy of the best model, which was generated by consensus of four algorithms 
with multi-dimensional molecular fingerprints, was 0.694 (RMSE) in the test dataset. 
Besides, the number of hydrogen bonds from MDFP has been determined as a critical 
factor in the predicting models, followed by rgyr and sasa. Our findings provide a new 
sight of MDFP and multi-dimensional molecular fingerprints in building models of 
hERG cardiotoxicity prediction.'
