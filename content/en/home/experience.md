        - Completed the subject between natural active product and α-amylase. After a virtual screening of Dalbergia odorifera, eriodictyol has been determined as the best natural active component and molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and spectroscopy were used for further analysis. This paper has already under review and is expected to be published in International Journal of Biological Macromolecule. 
        - Participated in the research on the mechanism of Costunolide-Induced MCF-7 Cells Apoptosis by finished molecular docking and paper’s revision. This paper has been published on Chemistry and Biodiversity.
        - Co-published patents as “Application of Eriocitrin in the preparation of drugs for inhibiting cardiovascular diseases” and “Application of Lentinus edodes mycelium polysaccharide in preparation of drugs to inhibit amylase activity”.
