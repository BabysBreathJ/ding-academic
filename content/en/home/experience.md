        - With the funding of the Innovation Practice Training Program for College Students held by Chinese Academy of Sciences, I completed a research on the plant-based dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes, and received a fund of CNY 40,000.
        - Applied Pubmed, web of science and Cochrane to retrieve relevant literature in the past ten years. After manual screening and summary, I included the remaining documents into my references and conducted a statistical analysis with Stata and R. in the end, it is found that plant-based diet patterns could significantly improve blood sugar control. A SCI paper is expected to be published.

        - Co-authored a review of B cell immortalization, which is expected to be published in SCI review journals.
        - Independently completed a meta-analysis on the drug resistance of AIDS populations in Henan Province. After collecting and collating relevant Chinese literature in the past ten years with R, I confirmed the association between drug resistance and the time of drug taking and performed a subgroup analysis. The paper is expected to be published in SCI journals of epidemiology and medicine.

        - Completed the subject of natural active product and α-amylase. Through a virtual screening of the main components of Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen, eriodictyol as the best natural active component was obtained, and a molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation research was performed. In the meantime, the exact mechanism of saccharol inhibiting α-amylase was experimentally confirmed. The paper is expected to be published on International Journal of Biological Macromolecule. 
        - Participated in the subject on the costane lactone-induced apoptosis mechanism, and took responsibilities for making molecular docking data and the writing and revising of the paper. The paper is expected to be published on Chemistry and Biodiversity.
        - Co-published two national invention patents related to the paper: "Application of Ericoside in the Preparation of Drugs for Inhibiting Cardiovascular Diseases" and "Application of Lentinus Mycelium Polysaccharides in the Preparation of Drugs for Inhibiting Amylase Activity". One patent certificate was obtained in January 2021 and the other one is expected to be obtained in June 2021.
