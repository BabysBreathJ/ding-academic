        - Completed the subject of natural active product and α-amylase. Through a virtual screening of the main components of Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen, eriodictyol as the best natural active component was obtained, and a molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation research was performed. In the meantime, the exact mechanism of saccharol inhibiting α-amylase was experimentally confirmed. The paper is expected to be published on International Journal of Biological Macromolecule. 
        - Participated in the subject on the costane lactone-induced apoptosis mechanism, and took responsibilities for making molecular docking data and the writing and revising of the paper. The paper is expected to be published on Chemistry and Biodiversity.
        - Co-published two national invention patents related to the paper: "Application of Ericoside in the Preparation of Drugs for Inhibiting Cardiovascular Diseases" and "Application of Lentinus Mycelium Polysaccharides in the Preparation of Drugs for Inhibiting Amylase Activity". One patent certificate was obtained in January 2021 and the other one is expected to be obtained in June 2021.
