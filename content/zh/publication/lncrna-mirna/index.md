abstract: 'Objective  A new method for predicting lncRNA-miRNA interactions based on a network similarity algorithm is proposed, which provides a new theoretical basis for further research on the mechanism of lncRNA-miRNA regulation of diseases. Methods  After screening the lncRNA-miRNA interaction data and the sequence, expression profile, and function data of lncRNAs and miRNAs in the lncRNASNP2, LNCipedia, miRbase, NONCODE, microRNA, and miRTarBase 7.0 database, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm was applied to analyze the sequence similarity of lncRNAs and miRNAs and integrate them into different similarity matrices. Finally, the NSILMI model was used for processing, and the predicted lncRNA-miRNA interaction score was obtained. Results  When α was 0.7, NSILMI based on sequence similarity achieved the highest prediction performance. In the 5-fold cross-validation, the area under the ROC curve was 0.9814, which showed a good prediction accuracy. AUC values calculated based on functional similarity and expression profile similarity were 0.8831 and 0.8654, respectively. Meanwhile, 16 of the 20 lncRNA-miRNA interaction pairs predicted by the NSILMI model had been verified experimentally. Conclusion  In this study, an NSILMI model was proposed to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. This model provides a new means for predicting lncRNA-miRNA association and provides new methods and new ideas for the study of complex diseases.'
